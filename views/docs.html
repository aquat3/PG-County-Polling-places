            Getting started with our polling app. <!--<b>Document what your endpoints(3) do. What does it do when you hit them.</b>-->

            This is how you use the polling app. The first step is to type in your address in the search bar that is located on the homepage 
            of the polling site application. The address that you type into the search bar can be your home address or the address of your current location
            but ensure that the address is a PG county address in order to get the best polling place results.

            There are many benefits to using our polling app. The goal is for our polling locator system to provide PG county 
            voters with a reliable way to quickly find their assigned or non-assigned nearest polling places to help them plan 
            ahead of time and make their voting process a little easier. Our team believes that our system can help increase the voter
            turnout rate in PG county. We know how important voting is in terms of shaping democracy in the United States that is why 
            residents need a reliable way of presenting that information in this age of unreliable data and fake news. <br><br>
            This polling application is designed to help users quickly find and search up to three open and available polling sites
            located anywhere in Prince Georges County Maryland that they can immediately go to and cast their votes if they wish. 
            Our team made this application because new and current residents of Prince Georges County residents wanted to have a 
            reliable source in helping them find the right polling places so this app should meet all their needs. We designed this application 
            based on the information that we collected from the conversations we had with new and current PG county residents.
            So our application was designed based on residents' demands and the opinions they have about the difficulties of 
            finding a reliable service that provides accurate polling sites that also integrates map and directional guidance.  
            We included full addresses and a map that shows the user exactly where their polling place is located by using the prince Georges 
            county map we acquired from Google. When the user types in their address into the search bar they get three recommended 
            polling locations that are nearest to them based on their home address or wherever they're located in PG county. 
            Users are given the freedom to choose any of the three recommended polling locations and they can also choose another 
            polling location other than the three our application recommends they choose from.<br><br>
            Elderly voters at PG county that aren't very familiar with online polling search engines will find this app 
            useful and very easy to use. The interface of the application is designed to suit almost all types of users. 
            Individuals that are not used to the internet that want to look up their polling locations will not find it 
            difficult to utilize this polling app since it's free of bloatware like advertisements and it's only designed 
            to handle polling location searches and nothing else.  Another reason to use this app is because it was designed 
            based on the feedback we received from PG count college students. Most students are usually busy with work and school life 
            so this app will enable them to quickly lookup the nearest polling sites that are closest to their current location like 
            their college campus for example. overall this polling place locator is supposed to provide you with a fast and a reliable service.
