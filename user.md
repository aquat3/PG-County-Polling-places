# User Manual 

## Rational and Motivation

When we first got the dataset, we had to figure out an information problem to solve. We decided that it be best to try and find users closets polling location to them. This is very useful because many users don’t know that you can go to another polling location that isn’t assigned to you.

## Users 

Users first must upload the website where the first page should be the home page. If not, the user can navigate using the navigation bar to go to the homepage. There the users will see a search bar, where the users can start to type their current address. The users will notice that the search bar will start to auto-suggest the address that they are typing. This is implemented so users don’t miss-spell and don’t have to input the whole address they can just pick it. 

Once the user has searched for the address they will be redirected to a new page where all the two or three nearest polling locations that are within a mile from the address you searched for. Each one of the recommended polling locations has helpful information like the full address of the actual polling location for navigation purposes and a map that pinpoints the exact location of each polling site. Now all the user must do is choose one of the polling sites the website recommended so they can go there and cast their vote. 

## StakeHolders 

The stakeholders for this website are the general public. In other words, its specifically catered to the citizens that live in Prince George’s county. Also the local government is a stakeholder as they can advocate Prince Georges County voters to find a location to cast their vote.
