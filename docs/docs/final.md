## Information Problem 

The information problem that we were trying to solve as a group is the fact that individuals don’t know that they can vote at other polling locations other than the one that was assigned to them by the government. In doing so we gave user nearest location to other polling places they could go to cast their vote. 

## StakeHolders 

The stakeholders for this website are the general public. In other words, its specifically catered to the citizens that live in Prince George’s county. Also the local government is a stakeholder as they can advocate Prince Georges County voters to find a location to cast their vote. 

## Dataset 

The dataset was gather from Prince Georges County data collection, the name of the dataset is Polling Places.

## Technology 

For the front-end we used the following:  

* HTML 
* CSS 
* JavaScript/JQuery 
* EJS 

Originally we were going to use React for a lot of the front end however, because some of us were not to familiar with it we ended up using HTML and CSS for a lot of the front end. 

For the back-end we used the following: 

* Node 
* MySQL 

We use Node for the backend to create the endpoints. And used MySQL to store the data from the dataset and query it fast and easily. 

And finally we used Google MAps Platform to provide the map, geocoding, and markers. Also Github and Heroku to host the application. 

## Solution to the Problem

How our application aims to solve our problem is by giving the user different locations to where they originally didn’t know they could go to vote. By giving users this new information, they will have more options to go out and vote especially if the location they were assigned gets busy they can pick an alternative one that may not be busy. 

## Challenges 

One of the challenges that we faced as a team was our different levels of experience of coding. One of the biggest was the documentation page and figuring out how to make it look like the schema we had designed earlier in our process. We couldn’t get it how we originally planned but compromised to something we all agreed we liked. In addition, we started out using React.js but had to switch over to HTML/CSS due to the difficulty of integrating the backend with it.

## Next and Future Steps 

What we could do with this information problem is by covering more counties and or the whole state. This website could also be implemented to include more states. In addition to including more areas the app could add information about how busy the location is, this would be very useful because it would spread all the voters to go to other location instead of making one very packed. This is also helpful because it brings in voters that are usually dithered from voting because of the wait, to come out and vote.
